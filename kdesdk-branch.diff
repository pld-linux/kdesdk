+to access hardware counters (often difficult with todays Linux installations), and binaries to be profiled can be left unmodified,

 The disadvantage of simulation slowdown can be reduced by doing the simulation only on the interesting program parts, and perhaps only on a few iterations of a loop. Without measurement/simulation instrumentation, Valgrinds usage only has a slowdown in the range of 3-5.
 And when only the call graph and call counts
 are of interest, the cache simulator can be switched off.

-<para>These are cost attributes for functions regarding some event type. As functions can call each other, it makes sense to distinguish the cost of the function itself ('Self Cost') and the cost including all called functions ('Inclusive Cost'). 'Self' is sometimes also referred to as 'Exclusive' costs.
